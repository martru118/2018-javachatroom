# java-chatroom
A Java chatroom I made with friends. This project was downloaded from my old account, where the forks can be seen. I handled the HTML styling of the chatroom while my friends handled the chat functionality. Chatroom must be executed using MyEclipse IDE in order to connect to Apache Tomcat servers. Download either one of the subfolders.
