# java-chatroom

A Java chatroom made with Java asnd deploys to an Apache Tomcat server. This was made in a team of 3 people in high school (12th grade, 2018).

I was responsible for organizing scrum meetings for my group and managing group progress with kanban. My code contributions were `chatroom/WebRoot/writerMes.jsp` and `chatroom/WebRoot/main.jsp`.

Unfortunately I no longer have access to the original repository, and it has been such a long time that I do not know how to get the code running or if it even works at all. I apologize for any inconviences this may cause.
